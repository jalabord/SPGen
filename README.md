# SPGen

A synthetic population generator.

Run it with the following command line  :

java -jar spGen.jar $SEED "FILE_IN"

e.g. java -jar spGen.jar 1 "input tables/target areas/2006_cd_subset.csv"

where SEED is the seed of the pseudo-random generator and FILE_IN contains a list of the area to be generated.

Alternatively, under a Linux environment the following command line can also be used:

./run_sp.sh SEED
