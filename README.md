# SPGen

A synthetic population generator.

Run it with the following command line  :

java -jar SPGen.jar $SEED "FILE_IN"

where SEED is the seed of the pseudo-random generator and FILE_IN contains a list of the area to be generated.

Alternatively, under a Linux environment the following command line can also be used:

./run_sp.sh SEED
